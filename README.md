# Working Efficiently with Stata in Shared Computing Environments
Shared computing environments are regularly used by academia, government, and industry.  While effective for the organization to manage costs and upkeep of computing infrastructure, working in a shared computing environment presents both unique benefits and challenges compared with using hardware owned/operated by the researcher. This talk will provide some advice to successfully navigate challenges in working in shared computing environments. Some topics will include dealing with memory and disk/storage constraints, leveraging metadata for documentation and infrastructure, standardizing project setup and workflow, and discussing some newer community-contributed tools that can maximize the efficiency of your computer consumption.
